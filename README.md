# Caesar Cipher Implementation

Overview

This project implements the Caesar Cipher algorithm in Python, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt text by shifting the letters in the message by a specified number of positions in the alphabet. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down or up the alphabet.

Features
Encryption: Users can input a plaintext message and a shift value to generate an encrypted message.
Decryption: Users can input an encrypted message and the same shift value to retrieve the original plaintext.
Case Sensitivity: The program maintains the case of the letters (uppercase and lowercase).
Non-alphabetic Characters: Characters that are not letters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) remain unchanged.
